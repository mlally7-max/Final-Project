    "I have downloaded my accounts spotify data with the entirity of my listening history. To collect ths data I went into my account profile and then went into the account privacy then scrolled down until the download mydata section and followe for listening history and then downloaded my extended listening history data from there and recieved an email in my inbox a few days later stating that my data was ready to be downloaded. I then downloaded the zip file and expanded it into usable data pages. It is split into mulitple different pages to cover the various songs and years that I have been using my spotify account. All of the files are housed within one folder for a chomprehensive look at my extended streaming history. For the sake of ease I may have to shrink my data to only one of the files, which from my research into the different pages would be part of a year, and maybe some of a boarding year depending on the breakdown and split. The files would be similar to those from the beginning of the semester and they are a json file type."
